									<b>Abstract: </b>
									Despite efforts in reducing incidents in horizontal construction projects, undesired crashes within work zones continue to happen, highlighting the need for work zone safety improvements. Various types of sensor-based worker alarm system (e.g., screaming cones, speed monitoring signs) have been deployed at work zones to alarm workers of potentially dangerous situations. However, researchers face the challenge of studying worker responses towards these alarms, since user studies cannot put subjects in real physical danger. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) is a testing technique where physical sensors (e.g., smartwatch) in a worker alarm system are connected to a virtual test system (i.e., virtual work zone virtual reality (VR) simulated with dangerous situations) that simulates reality. This allows for safe and realistic testing of a worker alarm system without putting workers in harms way. Traffic simulations can be developed to replicate realistic traffic patterns based on physical characteristics of the road and vehicles. However, researchers still face the challenge of integrating simulated traffic into VR environments, and vice versa, sending interactions between traffic and workers from VR back to traffic simulations. This study presents the development of an integrated platform that bridges the worker alarm system (i.e., worker monitoring and alarm hardware) and the virtual work zone (i.e., traffic simulation and VR with simulated dangerous situations), so that realistic worker behaviors towards alarms sent to them can be collected in user studies for the purpose of testing work zone safety systems (e.g., smartwatch-based worker alarm system) using the HIL paradigm. The integrated platform was tested in alpha experiments and shown to be effective to reproduce realistic traffic scenarios, scalable to different work zone settings (long-, intermediate-, short-term, or mobile).
